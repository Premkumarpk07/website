                <h3>Friendship</h3>
                <p>There are different types of people around us, amoung them we have friends to share our feelings, happiness, sorrow, etc.,I don't have many friends, but they are the golden one's who is with me all the time. I came across some persons such as if they bored or they have no one to talk to, they spoke to me. If they have someone, they don't even think about me.  </p>
